# traffic-prediction

This repository contains the code for our thesis project on predicting web traffic using machine learning techniques. Our goal was to forecast web traffic 1, 2, and 3 months into the future and compare the performance of different models in terms of speed, efficiency, and accuracy. The models we used were Nixtla, LSTM, and XGBoost
